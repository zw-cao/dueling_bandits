# dueling_bandits

## This repo covers:

1. Implement different dueling bandit algorithms, including versatile dueling bandits, double thompson sampling, interleaved filter, beat the mean, relative minimum empirical divergence and relative upper confidence bound.
2. Test the above six algorithms against two synthetic and two real datasets.
